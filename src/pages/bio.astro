        <h1 class="animate__animated animate__fadeInDown">Biography</h1>
        <p class="animate__animated animate__fadeInLeft">
            Abel Makkonen Tesfaye[a] was born on February 16, 1990, in Toronto, Ontario.[18] He is the only child of Ethiopian immigrants Makkonen Tesfaye and Samrawit Hailu,[b] who separated shortly after his birth.[20][21] He was brought up in the district of Scarborough by his mother and grandmother.[18][22] He has an estranged relationship with his father, in which he explained to Rolling Stone, "I saw him vaguely when I was six, and then again when I was 11 or 12, and he had a new family and kids. I don't even know where he lived — I'd see him for, like, a night. I'm sure he's a great guy. I never judged him. He wasn't abusive, he wasn't an alcoholic, he wasn't an asshole. He just wasn't there."[21]
        
            Tesfaye was raised as an Ethiopian Orthodox.[21][23] When asked whether or not he was still religious, he stated to Variety in 2020, "I dunno...everything is a test, and if you are religious or spiritual, you have to go through things."[24] His native language is Amharic, which he learned through his grandmother.[25] He later became fluent in French by attending a French-immersion school.[26] He was further educated at West Hill Collegiate Institute and Birchmount Park Collegiate Institute.[27]
            
            When he was 17, Tesfaye dropped out of school and moved to an apartment in the neighbourhood of Parkdale with two friends; including his best friend and now creative director La Mar Taylor.[28] He has described this period as being like the film Kids (1995) "without the AIDS", as they lived a hedonistic lifestyle.[18][29] He has also experienced homelessness and was incarcerated on several occasions during this time, which encouraged him to "smarten up, to focus."[30][31]
            
            Tesfaye often used drugs and abused illegal substances such as ketamine, cocaine, MDMA, magic mushrooms, and cough syrup.[32] In December 2016, he stated that drugs were a "crutch" for him when it came to writing music.[33] In August 2021, during a cover story with GQ, he described himself as being "sober lite", meaning that he has stopped using drugs with the exception of marijuana. He also noted that he drinks alcohol occasionally, stating: "I'm not a heavy drinker, as much as I used to be. The romance of drinking isn't there."[34] </p>
        
        <p class="animate__animated animate__fadeInLeft">In August 2009, Tesfaye began anonymously releasing music on YouTube.[35][36] The following year, he met Jeremy Rose, a producer who had an idea for a dark contemporary R&B project. After initially trying to pitch the idea to musician Curtis Santiago, Rose played one of his instrumentals for Tesfaye, who freestyle rapped over it. Rose produced three songs – "What You Need", "Loft Music" and "The Morning" – and others that Tesfaye had sung on, which were ultimately scrapped. Rose let Tesfaye keep the tracks he had produced under the condition that he would be credited for them.[37] In December 2010, Tesfaye uploaded "What You Need", "Loft Music" and "The Morning" to YouTube under the username "xoxxxoooxo".[38][39] His identity was initially unknown. The songs drew some attention online, and were later included in a blog post from rapper Drake.[37][40] The songs subsequently received coverage from various media outlets, including Pitchfork and The New York Times.[41]
        
            Before adopting the stage name the Weeknd, Tesfaye released music under two aliases; the Noise and Kin Kane.[21] His current stage name was chosen in tribute to when he dropped out of school, took his mattress, "left one weekend and never came home." However, Rose claims the name was his idea.[42][43] The last 'e' was excluded to avoid trademark problems with pop rock band the Weekend.[44] In the beginning of his career, Tesfaye worked at American Apparel. Due to his anonymity, his co-workers listened to his music without knowing it was him.[45][46][47]
            
            In 2011, Tesfaye met music executives Wassim "Sal" Slaiby and Amir "Cash" Esmailian, with whom, along with Taylor, he founded the XO record label.[48] On March 21, Tesfaye released his debut mixtape House of Balloons.[49][50][51] The mixtape included production from producers Illangelo and Doc McKinney, and included the tracks produced by Rose, although he did not receive production credits.[37] House of Balloons was named as one of ten shortlisted nominees for the 2011 Polaris Music Prize.[52] On August 18, Tesfaye released his second mixtape Thursday, which received generally positive reviews.[53] His third mixtape, Echoes of Silence, was released on December 21. It was a longlisted nominee for the 2012 Polaris Music Prize.[54][55]
            
            In July 2011, Tesfaye held his first live performance at the Mod Club Theatre in Toronto.[56] After the performance, Drake met with Tesfaye to discuss collaborations, which led to Tesfaye earning an appearance at his OVO Festival.[57] He also participated in concerts hosted by the Black Student Association at the University of Toronto.[47][58] Tesfaye contributed to four songs on Drake's second studio album Take Care, which was released on November 15, as a songwriter, producer and a featured artist on the album's seventh single "Crew Love".[59] </p>

It also debuted at number five on the Canadian Albums Chart, with similar sales.[72][73] The album was later certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) and double-platinum by Music Canada.[74][75] It also earned Tesfaye a nomination for the Sound of 2013 poll award by BBC.[76]
